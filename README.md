🌍 Climate Action Web App (AQI · Carbon · Trees

​🌿 Project Overview
​The Climate Action Web App is a lightweight, single-page utility designed to empower users with quick, actionable environmental data. It simplifies complex concepts like air quality and carbon emissions into intuitive, easy-to-use tools.

​✨ Key Features
​🌫️ AQI Checker: Input any Air Quality Index (AQI) value to instantly receive the health advisory (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.).
​🌱 Carbon Footprint Calculator: Calculates a personal "Carbon Score" based on daily inputs for travel distance and electricity usage, advising the user on their emission level (Low, Moderate, High).
​🌳 Tree Impact Estimator: Allows users to select specific tree species (like Neem, Peepal, Banyan) to see the estimated yearly Carbon Reduction and AQI Improvement they provide.

​💻 Technology Stack
​This application is built for speed and simplicity, using a foundational web stack:
​HTML5: Structure and Semantics
​CSS3: Responsive Styling and custom UI aesthetics.
​Vanilla JavaScript: All core logic, navigation, and calculation features.
